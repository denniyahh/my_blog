For a product manager who has always loved playing with technology but never fully crossed the Rubicon to becoming a developer, I'm super excited that we are about to enter what I believe will be the Golden Age of product development for non-programmers, driven by AI.

My goal with this site is to document my personal transformation into a full-stack AI product developer by leveraging the best available AI tools, services, and agentic systems for people like me--more product oriented but not completely technically uninclined.

This space will also serve as my personal blog, which I hope to eventually do some more long-form writing on. But for now, it will be mostly focused on serving as the first testbed for my AI-assisted technical endeavors.

Towards that end, here is my current tech stack that I have sort of been cobbling together to help me learn as I go along while I try to figure out what in exactly the heck I'm doing

## My Tech Stack (v1.0)

* Jekyll static blog engine with styling assets being served via Vite (as I intend to design my own themes)
* Doing all my development inside of a devpod, where I am also experminting with using Nix Flakes for easily reproducible dev environments
* Been experimenting with using Codex, Cursor, and Warp for AI-assisted coding, the latter two of which I've played around with in prior contexts, so have mostly used Codex for this project so far
* My linux host system is running Fedora Aurora, which is a whole other topic of conversation, but worth mentioning because playing around with that has been a fantastic learning experience
* Hosting my site on Github Pages using Github Actions for my CI/CD pipeline

### Next Steps

I plan to keep my posts fairly snappy, since attention spans... I will be following up shortly, though, with some more specifics on what I plan to do with this site, and some of the upcoming enhancements and "experiments" I am planning for this project.

If you have made it this far, I sincerely thank you, whoever you may be. And may this mark just the beginning of what will prove to be a long and very fruitful adventure together!

Much thanks,

Dennis
